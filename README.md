-The main page is the showform.php where you have to fill in the requested information.

-If you want to search someone and all their information which has been submitted, you can go to the listening.php where u just need to put the name of the person u would like to find.

-connectiondb.php and connection_es.php all are just for the connection to the database, I put the data to be submitted in mysql and es.

-functionsf.php and functionlist.php are files of what should be done by php like searching in the listening and put the filled information in the main page

-funtion.php and set_messages.php are files for flash messages, it doesn't work when I fill the form, but when I submit the form without information it displays the message.
